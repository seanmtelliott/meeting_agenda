\section*{Notes for Dec 18 Meeting}
\subsection*{What I have done:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Papers about divorce/separation/cohabitation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Read some of the literature on divorce/separation and also how it relates to cohabitation. [Some of the more interesting ones: \citet{weiss1997match}, \citet{brien2006cohabitation}, \citet{matouschek2008economics}, \citet{kulu2010premarital}, \citet{lundberg2016family}, \citet{folke2020all}] 

\item Nothing really to note on comparing costs of separation in marriage vs. cohabitation. [\citet{tach2015trends} do a bit of analysis showing decreases in household income are roughly the same in cases of divorce and dissolving a cohabitating partnership.]

\item There is some interesting stuff about measuring cohabitation in survey data. [\citet{manning2005measuring}, \citet{fitch2005rise}, \citet{kennedy2012measuring}, \citet{manning2019measuring}]

\item I also looked at \citet{mourifie2021cobb} to see what kind of cohabitation information they are using. They used US census data from 1990, 2000, and 2010. 

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Data sources}
\begin{itemize}
\item I have narrowed in on a few promising candidates - all US data.
\begin{itemize}
\item Current Population Survey (CPS): A monthly US survey which tracks households for 4 months at a time at two separate times. Has reliable cohabitation information starting in 2007. I have the data and am playing around with it.
\item National Longitudinal Survey of Youth - 1997 Cohort (NLSY97): Follows a sample of Americans born in the years 1980-84 (about 9000 of them). Very detailed, but somewhat restrictive given that it is just one cohort.
\item National Survey of Family Growth: A repeated cross section, initially only tracked women but men were added in 2015. Cohabitation is identified through a question "have you ever/are you currently living with...".
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\item \textbf{I met with Aloysius}
\begin{itemize}
\item He gave me some useful information (unsurprisingly) and some papers to read.
\item Measuring cohabitation rates historically is a paper by itself.
\item For endogenizing separation in the \citet{choo2006marries} and \citet{choo2015dynamic} framework, he advised taking the simplest approach, some logit form which ultimately produces a simple/tractable MMF.
\end{itemize}



\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What is still left to do:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Consider the simplest model of divorce/separation where we only observe hazard rates}
\begin{itemize}
\item Dependent on how well I am able to identify cohab dissolution from CPS - as this is the most representative sample, I'd prefer to use it.
\item I need to try this with all 3 sources listed above and see if they are all similar.
\item Not a lot of examples in the literature of people trying to do this.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Write an intro chapter for my thesis}
\begin{itemize}
\item I would like to do a proper lit review and synthesize all of the information I've read through.
\item Fully document all of the trends in marriage, divorce/separation, fertility, and cohabitation. It hasn't been done in a while and there are likely some interesting things to note regarding the period post-2008 and COVID. Include some reduced-form analyses.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
