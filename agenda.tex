\section*{Notes for September 11 Meeting}
\subsection*{General updates:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Committee}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added Aloysius and I'm meeting with Jiaying on Friday afternoon and will ask if she will also join
\item Set up a meeting after that
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Presentation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I will be presenting in the labour/public finance/related fields (LAPUFIR) seminar on Wednesday Nov 13 at 1 PM.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Project updates:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Predicting historical cohabitation}
\begin{itemize}
\item I'm currently training a neural net on cohabitation data from 2007 to 2024 and I have census data all the way back to 1900 to use for out of sample prediction.
\item There is a ton of data to process so this is a bit of a challenge computationally.
\item I'm working on a stochastic gradient descent algorithm but it isn't cooperating with me at the moment.
\end{itemize}


\item \textbf{Decline of marriage}
\begin{itemize}
\item Exploring the question of how political polarization affects search frictions in the marriage/dating market for young people.
\item I think this can be done without observing individual-level voting behaviour. 
\item This relies on having county-level variation in political polarization amongst young people. That is, I need to observe some areas which are politically homogenous and some which are heterogeneous.
\item The first stage is then to show that there is correlation between matching/meeting rates and the direction young men/women vote. 
\item Currently looking for the data for this.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Endogenous separation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I have some model preliminaries to share. (See other print out)
\end{itemize}



\end{itemize}
