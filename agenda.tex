\section*{Notes for November 27 Meeting}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Find the canonical text(s) for demographic transitions in economics}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Population Economics}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Understanding Demographic Transitions - Diebolt and Perrin (2017) [Largely a collection of stylized facts, tracking the changes in the demography of France over time. A useful reference to provide historical perspective but no theory.]
\item Population - John R. Weeks (2015) [Forms the basis of an undergraduate population economics course not necessarily aimed at economists.]
\item Population Economics - Razin and Sadka (1995) [An advanced undergrad or graduate course on population economics.]
\item Population Dynamics - Chu (1998) [Quite theoretical, is primarily aimed at researchers in population economics or a PhD field course.]\
\end{itemize}
\item \textit{Mathematical Demography}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Modelling Population Dynamics - Newman et al. (2014) [Not necessarily looking at demography, contains a review of state space models for changes in animal populations.]
\item Mathematical Demography - Smith and Keyfitz (2013) [Largely a collection of classical papers (from 1800s-1960s) of reduced-form analysis of demographic transitions - not particularly useful but interesting from a historical perspective.]
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Not entirely sure where to start here. It could be useful to read Razin and Sadka (1995) first and then move on to Chu (1998). They are both relatively short, so it wouldn't take too much time.

I have also looked through a few syllabi for both undergraduate and graduate courses in population economics to find references. The Weeks text was used in an undergraduate course (Colorado State) and then the graduate courses (Berkeley and McMaster) were just a reading list of papers -- some of which I have included below.

\item \textbf{Papers on demographic transition:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Historical Context/First Demographic Transition}:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item \textit{Second demographic transition}:\footnote{In 2015 the political economist Nicholas Eberstadt said in a NYT article: ``Long stable marriages are out, and divorce or separation are in, along with serial cohabitation and increasingly contingent liaisons.''}

\begin{itemize}
