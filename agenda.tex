%\subsection*{Project updates:}

\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Upcoming presentations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CEAs at the end of May in Montreal.
		\item RCEA conference at beginning of June in New Jersey.
		\item I'll try to present a couple times internally (SWEAT and LAPUFIR) during the summer.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dissertation chapters}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Second demographic transition paper (JMP): 
\begin{itemize}
	\item I'm currently rewriting the draft, should be done in a week or so.
	\item Will slowly make improvements over the summer as I present and get feedback.
\end{itemize}


\item Political polarization of marriage: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item I presented something about housing in the last committee meeting. That is really a separate paper, and really goes with this polarization topic.
	\item More liberal and progressive areas are substantially more expensive and this is also related to household formation.
	\item Not only is there divergent ideas between young men and women but also substantial divergence between left and right in marriage and fertility.
	\item Aim to have a rough draft by the end of summer.
\end{itemize}
\item Recovering historical cohabitation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item This is the neural net approach to uncovering past cohabitation rates.
	\item I'm still tuning the model and trying different things.
	\item However, most of the work is already done, I will put together a draft in the next couple of months.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Job market preparation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item What should I be doing now to prepare?
\end{itemize}
